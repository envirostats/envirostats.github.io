## R Language for Statistical Computing in Business Analysis (EXGEN5449)

Hello and welcome to our course website! My name is Stefan Schreiber and I am your course instructor for [EXGEN5449](https://www.ualberta.ca/extension/continuing-education/courses/EXGEN-5449).

In this course, I will provide with an introduction to the R programming language to perform data manipulation, data visualization and basic statistical analyses. Since this will be an introductory course, you won't need any prior experience in R, however, if you do, it will certainly be helpful. I designed the course to be hands-on, which means I will refrain from providing lecture-type presentations but instead spend time with you writing R code and answer questions as they appear. As with any other language at first it may seem impossible to ever get good at it but with time and practice you will become a data science wizard. 

For this course, we will be working with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/). If you feel like it, you can visit those links and install R and R Studio on your laptops (but we will do this together in class as well!). That being said, for this course you need a laptop, the aforementioned programs, a web browser, and a spreadsheet editor such as Excel might come in handy but is not required (NotePad is sufficient).

I also recommend two books to serve as a reference guides. The first one is called [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the second one is [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/). You can read both books online for free, or purchase a hard-copy from Amazon if you prefer.

On March 15, I will upload all course material for the respective days (see navigation pane above).

As of now I am planning to cover the following topics (but I am flexible and can adapt to the needs of you guys!):
